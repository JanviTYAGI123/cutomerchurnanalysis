Data Analysis Key Findings
The churn rate varies significantly across different tenure brackets and senior citizen status.
Customers with shorter tenure, particularly in the 0-12 month bracket, exhibit higher churn rates, irrespective of senior citizen status.
Senior citizens consistently show a higher churn rate compared to non-senior citizens across most tenure brackets.
The difference in churn rate between senior citizens and non-senior citizens is more pronounced in the earlier tenure brackets.
As tenure increases, the churn rate generally decreases for both groups, but the churn rate for senior citizens remains higher than that of non-senior citizens within the same tenure bracket.
Insights or Next Steps
Focus retention efforts on new customers (0-12 months tenure), especially senior citizens, as they have the highest churn rates.
Investigate the specific reasons for higher churn among senior citizens to develop targeted retention strategies.
